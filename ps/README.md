Pokestud: Gotta Pass 'em All! is a studdy-buddy app
created for the CST spring 2014 project term. The goal 
of this app is to help CST students study in a way that 
is more engaging than flash cards or powerpoint slides.

The rules of the game are simple, take tests in various
CST courses to earn points, and use those points to buy
items for your study buddy. Each screen in game has a 
help screen that you should refer to if you are ever stuck.
